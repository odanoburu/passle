- salt?
  - the key already works as a salt, but it's somewhat predictable, so
    an attacker could try and make tables that would work for
    everyone's passwords; adding a random salt for each user defeats
    this (making personal tables necessary), but reduces hassle's
    portability (you have to hold on to your sites directory, which is
    not true if you use simple keys)
